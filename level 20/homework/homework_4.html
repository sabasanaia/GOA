     <p>With the fifth and final season ready to wrap up the story, the Stranger Things timeline is so twisty and complex that it needs considerable examination. It all began in November 1983 and, so far, stops in March 1986 at the end of Stranger Things season 4. What's more, there's plenty of history alluded to, spanning from the founding of Hawkins in the 1800s to the 1970s, when Eleven was born and the rest of the kids were born. The complete Stranger Things timeline shows the key moments in the series that will bring audiences to the final season.</p>

    <p>The ending takes place in 2023. The “five years later” time jump is another five years after 2018, when the majority of the film is set, and the film explicitly says that 2014 was “nine years ago.” The Avengers, having traveled through time to collect all six Infinity Stones from before Thanos destroyed them, made a special glove containing all six stones and put it on Hulk. He snapped his fingers, thus restoring everybody Thanos had dusted in Infinity War back to life at the present moment — not five years in the past, when the dusting actually happened.</p>
